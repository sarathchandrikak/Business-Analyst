# KNN Algorithm

* K - Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
* Categorized as Supervised Algorithm when used for classification and Regression tasks.
* Also known as Lazy Algorithm, since there is no training phase. 
* Out of all possible values, right value of K is determined based on the error. For a right value of k, error is minimum.
* Knn are categorized based on the distance between the points. There are various ways in which distance can be calculated.
    * Manhattan Distance - Sum of absolute differences between the two points, accross all dimensions.
    * Eucledian Dstance - Shortest Distance between the two points
    * Hamming Distance - Total number of distances between two strings of ideal length.
* To avoid misinterpreting the distance between points data scaling should be done while implementing distance based algorithms.
